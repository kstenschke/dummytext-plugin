h1. Dummy Text Generator Plugin

Source code of the intellij IDEA "Dummy Text Generator" plugin: http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin?pr=&pluginId=7216
This is a plugin for the various intellij IDEs, working in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and Community Edition, 
RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm, PyCharm CE, AppCode, Android Studio and 0xDBE.


h2. Description

The plugin adds a random text generator, capable of creating witty texts in different genres.
Created text can be inserted newly at the caret, or replace a selection.
The dummy text generator is added to the main menu, tools menu and into the generate... popup menu (Alt+Insert)

The plugin allows to choose from several genres:

* Culinary Inspirations
* Esoteric Wisdom
* Fake Latin (similar to "Lorem Ipsum" blindtext)
* Pirate Lingo
* Science Fiction

When replacing a multi-lined selection of text, the generated dummy text maintains the amount of lines.
When replacing a selection of text within a single line, the amount of words is roughly being maintained.
When the replaced text selection consists fully of lower-cased or capital letters or begins with a capital letter,
that previous casing is maintained. Furthermore, the presence or absence of a trailing punctuation mark of a
replaced text selection is being maintained.
